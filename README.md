Rules

Routing

Ensure that all pages are properly routed using a consistent routing mechanism (e.g., React Router or another framework).

Routes must not break when navigating between pages.

Use meaningful and intuitive route paths (e.g., /home, /about, /contact, etc.).


Proper Working Links

All internal and external links must be functional.

Links to other sections, pages, or external websites should not lead to a 404 page or any broken state.

Verify each link thoroughly before pushing changes.


Text Guidelines

Text on all pages must be grammatically correct and appropriately formatted.

Use headings, paragraphs, and lists where necessary for readability.

Maintain consistency in font styles and sizes across the pages.


All Pages Must Work

Every page in the application should be functional without any console errors or runtime crashes.

Test all pages on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

Report any bugs or issues in the GitHub Issues section and ensure they are fixed before deployment.


Deployment

The application must be deployed and accessible via a public link.

Ensure that the deployment is stable and follows the latest code from the main branch.

Verify the deployment for proper routing, working links, and error-free pages before considering the project complete.
